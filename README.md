the server will check for buses travelling via the given route in real time and relay the same on the clients portal.
to reduce the hassle of carrying change and standing in long queues, the app provides an online payment feature for issuing an e-ticket.
Customers who purchase e-tickets receive a notification from the app a few minutes before the bus arrives at the specified location.
A user can change his ticket to board another bus travelling the same route if he buys a ticket but arrives at the bus stop late.
When a user cancels a ticket, they are given a specific number of Bus-kar coins that can be used on their subsequent trips.
All partnered buses have a shared data, which helps operators plan routes and manage resources more efficiently, by informing about possible congestion, obstacles and breakdowns on the road.
A thorough report on the operation of the bus, including daily travel time, kilometres covered, etc., is given to the bus owner at the end of each month.
