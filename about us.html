    <h3>MAKING TRAVEL EASY FOR EVERYONE</h3>
    <p>Buses are one of the most used transport facilities across the country. We at Bus-kar aim to make travelling by bus
    a more convenient and a time efficient journey for all.</p>

    <h3>The problem:</h3>
    <p>In India, buses are the most popular means of public transportation but the route, traffic, mechanical issues, and
    other factors can all have an impact on when and where a bus arrives. People must wait at the bus station for a long
    period of time without knowing when the bus will arrive.There is currently no system in place that informs
    passengers if a bus is on schedule or not.</p>

    <h3>Our Idea:</h3>
    <p>To help reduce these problems we are here with this app which will do exactly what the commuters wish for.Our
    software allows commuters to track the real-time position of buses as well as bus e-tickets, minimising the burden
    of carrying change or standing in long lines. With this data at hand users can plan their trips and book tickets
    conveniently.</p>
